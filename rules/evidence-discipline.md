# Every conclusion needs three derivations: forward, backward, cross-check

**Before any conclusion is stated, all three steps must be complete, and each one
spelled out.** Missing any of them makes it a hypothesis — write it as a hypothesis,
not as a conclusion.

| Step | What it asks | If you cannot do this, you did not do it |
|---|---|---|
| **Forward** | derive the conclusion from mechanism / code / data | you can name "which command, which lines of code, which data file" |
| **Backward** | **if this conclusion were false, what should I have seen?** Then go look | you can name a **specific observation, achievable this round**, and state that it did not appear |
| **Cross-check** | reproduce the same judgement by an independent route | the two routes **do not share** the same code, the same sample, or the same tool |

Backward is the step most often skipped, and it is the most valuable: forward can only
tell you "this explanation is consistent"; backward is what rules out "another
explanation is also consistent".

## A hypothesis must be refutable by observation, or it is not a hypothesis

After writing a hypothesis down, **first ask "what phenomenon would overturn it".**
If you cannot answer, it has not taken shape yet — do not build an experiment on it.

**To rule a hypothesis out you need either a falsifiable observation or an explicit
statement that this is inference.** "I cannot think of another explanation" does not
constitute ruling out.

## The backward-reasoning gap specific to filesystems

Most quantities measured in this project are **binary** — right or wrong. The risk is
not measurement precision, it is coverage:

- **"All tests green" does not mean "the implementation is correct".** The crash
  window may be one write wide; not hitting it may only mean that crash point was
  never enumerated. To claim "crash consistency holds", state whether this round
  **could have hit it at all** — how many crash points were enumerated, and whether
  that was all of them.
- **"The checker reported nothing" does not mean "the image is good".** The checker
  may simply not have implemented that check yet. Before saying it, look at the
  implementation status of the corresponding entry in `kb/invariants.md`.
