# Every conclusion needs three derivations: forward, backward, cross-check

**Before any conclusion is stated, all three steps must be complete, and each one
spelled out.** Missing any of them makes it a hypothesis — write it as a hypothesis,
not as a conclusion.

| Step | What it asks | If you cannot do this, you did not do it |
|---|---|---|
| **Forward** | derive the conclusion from mechanism / code / data | you can name "which command, which lines of code, which data file" |
| **Backward** | **if this conclusion were false, what should I have seen?** Then go look | you can name a **specific observation, achievable this round**, and state that it did not appear |
| **Cross-check** | reproduce the same judgement by an independent route | the two routes **do not share** the same code, the same sample, or the same tool |

Backward is the step most often skipped, and it is the most valuable: forward can only
tell you "this explanation is consistent"; backward is what rules out "another
explanation is also consistent".

## The cross-check path must itself be shown to go red

"Reproduce the same judgement by a second, independent path" is not enough —
**that second path can itself be a decoration.**

When two paths agree, it may mean "both are right", or it may mean **the second one
was never looking**. Without fault injection you cannot tell these apart, and
**they look identical: both are agreement.**

**What to do**: inject a known fault into the subject under test — one the second path
*ought* to catch — and confirm that it does. If it does not, that cross-check is
decoration, and every earlier record of "the two paths agree" is void with it.

Example: the kernel's block-layer counters are used to cross-check the I/O counts a
program keeps for itself, and the two agree cell for cell. That agreement only becomes
evidence once you have also observed that **dropping direct I/O sends the block-layer
count to zero while the program's own count does not move at all** — otherwise the
agreement could just be the second path echoing the first.

**This is the same discipline as "every verification must be able to fail", applied to
the cross-check path**: the main check must be shown to go red, and so must the
cross-check. **Showing only the former is doing half the work.**

## Background material fed into multi-party argumentation must itself be checked first

When cross-checking a conclusion across multiple independent sources, you typically
write up a "known facts" brief and hand it to each party. **Every external fact in
that brief must be checked by the person asking the question, first.**

The reason is mechanical: **every party takes it as a given, so an error in the brief
gets inherited by all of them together** — and they will still come back with an
"agreement". **Agreement therefore stops being evidence.**

Observed: a background brief stated that some production implementation "has no
such-and-such field". One of the three parties itself found the opposite in the
primary source — **and still used the brief's claim as the baseline for comparison.**
The eventual agreement was three parties jointly inheriting the same error.

**What to do**: before writing "implementation X works like this" into the brief,
check it yourself. What you cannot check, mark "unverified", so every party knows not
to treat that line as a given.

## A hypothesis must be refutable by observation, or it is not a hypothesis

After writing a hypothesis down, **first ask "what phenomenon would overturn it".**
If you cannot answer, it has not taken shape yet — do not build an experiment on it.

**To rule a hypothesis out you need either a falsifiable observation or an explicit
statement that this is inference.** "I cannot think of another explanation" does not
constitute ruling out.

## The backward-reasoning gap specific to filesystems

Most quantities measured in this project are **binary** — right or wrong. The risk is
not measurement precision, it is coverage:

- **"All tests green" does not mean "the implementation is correct".** The crash
  window may be one write wide; not hitting it may only mean that crash point was
  never enumerated. To claim "crash consistency holds", state whether this round
  **could have hit it at all** — how many crash points were enumerated, and whether
  that was all of them.
- **"The checker reported nothing" does not mean "the image is good".** The checker
  may simply not have implemented that check yet. Before saying it, look at the
  implementation status of the corresponding entry in `kb/invariants.md`.
